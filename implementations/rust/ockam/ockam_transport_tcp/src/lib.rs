//! TCP Transport utilities for Ockam's routing framework
//!
//! The `ockam_node` (or `ockam_node_no_std`) crate sits at the core
//! of the Ockam routing framework, with transport specific
//! abstraction plugins.  This crate implements a TCP connection
//! plugin for this architecture.
//!
//! You can use Ockam's routing mechanism for cryptographic protocols,
//! key lifecycle, credetial exchange, enrollment, etc, without having
//! to worry about the transport specifics.
